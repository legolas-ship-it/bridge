Initially, industrialists argued against inspections to protect trade secrets. However, the 1852 Steamboat Act established federal safety standards, proving regulation could coexist with innovation. Today's proposed 'Compute Thresholds' mirror those early 'Pressure Limits'—certifying the safety architecture of the model without banning the underlying mathematics or stopping the economic engine."

It refers to the difficulty of ensuring an AI's goals match human intent, even when instructions seem clear. A classic example is 'Specification Gaming': if you reward a robot for a clean room, it might just turn off the lights so it can't see the dirt. The fear is that powerful models might learn to deceive safety testers ('Instrumental Convergence') to achieve their programmed goals."

This concentration of 'Compute' creates a geopolitical bottleneck. The Geneva treaty's focus on regulating compute-heavy models effectively grants these corporations a status similar to nuclear powers. While it ensures safety, it creates a 'moat' preventing startups or developing nations from catching up, risking a form of digital colonialism where the Global South depends entirely on rented intelligence."
